# 🛰️ Urbanization Monitoring – Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka (2015–2025)

Satellite-based urban growth analysis using Landsat imagery and geospatial data science techniques to monitor urban expansion, vegetation change, and future development potential in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka.

## 📌 Project Description

#### This project analyzes urbanization trends from 2015 to 2025 in Anuradhapura District using Landsat 8 satellite imagery.
It focuses on detecting urban growth, evaluating land cover and vegetation changes, and identifying potential future development zones to support sustainable urban planning and environmental management.

#### The study combines remote sensing, GIS, and time-series analysis using Python.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Monitor spatial and temporal urban expansion (2015–2025)
- Detect urban land cover changes using spectral indices
- Analyze vegetation trends using NDVI
- Perform change detection between baseline and endpoint years
- Identify potential future urban growth areas
- Generate maps, graphs, and analytical visual outputs

## 📍 Study Area
- Location: Anuradhapura District, North Central Province, Sri Lanka
- Significance: UNESCO World Heritage region
- Climate: Dry zone
- Key Activities: Agriculture, tourism, administration

## 🛰️ Data Sources
### Satellite Imagery
- Source: USGS EarthExplorer
- Satellite: Landsat 8
- Product: Collection 2 – Level 2 Surface Reflectance

- Threshold-based urban classification

### Temporal Analysis
- Annual & monthly urban extent calculation
- Growth rate and seasonal pattern analysis

### Change Detection
- Pixel-wise comparison (2015 vs 2025)
- Same-season comparison to reduce false change

### Vegetation & Land Cover Analysis
- NDVI trend analysis
- Estimation of land-use conversion

### Potential Growth Area Mapping
- Multi-criteria suitability analysis
- Weighted overlay classification (5 zones)

### Predictive Modeling
- ARIMA
 Prophet
- Random Forest Regression
- Urban growth projection (2026–2030)

## 📊 Key Findings (Summary)
Urban area increased from ~35.30 km² (2015) to ~36.94 km² (2025)

Net urban growth of ~1.64 km²

Expansion concentrated along major transport corridors

District-wide vegetation improved (NDVI: 0.18 → 0.29)

Agricultural land was the main contributor to urban expansion

High-potential future growth zones identified near existing infrastructure

## ⚠️ Limitations
30 m resolution limits small-scale urban feature detection

No ground-truth accuracy assessment

Predictive models based only on historical trends

### 🔮 Future Improvements

High-resolution imagery integration

Inclusion of socio-economic data

Urban heat island and flood risk analysis

Automated monitoring dashboard
